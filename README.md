# Breadth-first threading

The solution of the task described in [this article](https://habrahabr.ru/post/276673/) with `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity.

Correctness of this solution is demonstrated by comparing the results of the classic breadth-first tree traversal (using queue) with the breadth-first traversal using this type of threading.
